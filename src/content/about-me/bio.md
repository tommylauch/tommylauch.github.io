# How I started astrophysics

I did my undergrad at HKU with a double major in Physics and Geology, with a research project on orbital dynamics. Then, I continued as an MPhil student working on planet formation model, with the Solar System in mind. Upon graduation, I moved to Munich and have been working on combining dust evolution in the disc with the model to capture the time and location of planetesimal formation.
