# How I started astrophysics

I did my undergrad at HKU with a double major in Physics and Geology, with a research project on orbital dynamics. Then, I continued as an MPhil student working on planet formation model, with the Solar System in mind. Upon graduation, I did my PhD in Munich and have been working on combining dust evolution in the disc with the model to capture the time and location of planetesimal formation. Recently (Jan 2025), I moved to UChicago for as a postdoc and continue working on planet formation theories and models.
